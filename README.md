# hello-world
I didn't know I was supposed to do this already. Well then...


Because I have a Bachelor's Degree in Arts and Technology I am self-teaching C++ and C#. When I graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas, I wanted to be a Video Game Developer. I received the degree but I could never get in the right direction for the career. After all the trials I took, I finally came to the conclusion that I needed to learn more computer science then art to truly achieve this; that is why I am teaching myself the languages now. I would LOVE to work for a company, even momentarily free, that can help me complete my training. I mostly know the basics of the computer science, like variables, data types, functions/methods, arrays and vectors, conditional and switch statements and I want to take it to the next level, and to the next, and the next after that. I know I have the capacity to learn this and I merely need the right direction.
